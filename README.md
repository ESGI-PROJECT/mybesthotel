# Install
To install the project, first you need to get the sources on github: [here](https://github.com/ESGIDIW-22/mybesthotel).

You also need to have nodejs js installed. You can download the lastest version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

`Note : Be sure to install nodejs globaly so you can access it via command line anywhere`

Once you're done with nodejs, go to the project repository and run the following command in a terminal.
```bash
    $ npm install
```

After all dependencies have been installed juste run

```bash
    $ gulp webserver
```

to run the webserver and run the app.
